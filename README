QtDMM 1.0.0 (c) 2001-2016 M.Toussaint

QtDMM is a simple DMM readout software including a configurable transient 
recorder. A friend of mine asked me  for a DMM readout software for Linux 
because he didn't want to use  the MS-Windows version which came with the 
multimeter. To help  him out I wrote this little piece of software.
The transient recorder features manual start, scheduled start (at a given 
time) and  triggered automatic  start when given  thresholds are reached.

If you call QtDMM  with the commandline option --console it  will display
some debug output. This might (or hight not :) help resolve problems.

It was written  for Metex (and compatible like VOLTCRAFT)  multimeter.
following DMM's are supported by QtDMM. (some needs user confirmation)

If you manage to  get QtDMM working  with a  digital multimeter different 
from the mentioned  above, or if you can confirm  one of the  unconfirmed
models please give a note. For a new multimeter the best would be sending
me a saved configuration file.
