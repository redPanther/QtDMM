# QtDMM

**QtDMM** is a simple, cross-platform digital multimeter (DMM) readout application
with a built-in, configurable transient recorder. It's especially useful for users
of older multimeters whose original software no longer runs on modern operating
systems.

QtDMM provides a reliable, open-source alternative to outdated or proprietary DMM
software and continues to work on current **Linux** and **macOS** systems
(*Windows support is currently limited/untested*).


## Features

- Transient Recorder
  - Manual start
  - Scheduled start at a specific time
  - Automatic start triggered when defined thresholds are reached
- various connection backends
  - RS232 Serial (USB-Serial and native UART)
  - USB HID-serial support (HOITEK HE2325U & compatible)
  - RFC2217 Remote Serial
  - Sigrok support via sigrok-cli application
- supports lots of DMMs, see list below
  - custom serial settings dialog for yet unknown DMMs

## Key Advantages

- Supports many RS232-based/USB-based multimeters
- Recording via network remote with RFC2217 remote serial support
- No proprietary software required
- Fully **open source** and GPL-V3 licensed
- Easy to use and extend


## Supported hardware

Following DMM's are supported by QtDMM. We currently don't know the state
of all DMMs. They worked at one time, but they could have issues today.
A list of driver state is planed, stay tuned. If you can confirm a DMM is
working, let us know.

Devices supported through sigrok can also be used via the sigrok-cli tool.
Native support is recommended when available; otherwise, the sigrok backend
provides a flexible fallback.


If you manage to  get QtDMM working  with a  digital multimeter different 
from the mentioned  above, or if you can confirm  one of the  unconfirmed
models please give a note.

## Commandline options
If you call QtDMM  with the commandline option --debug it  will display
some debug output. This might (or might not) help resolve problems.


## Notes
to use RFC2217 remote serial you have to edit the config file.
- open ~/.config/QtDMM/QtDMM.config
- in section [Port%20settings] add new entry static_device0=RFC2217 127.0.0.1:4000 edit ip and port accordingly.
- up to 10 devices (0-9) are supported in config. Later this will be available via config dialog
- on remote host with DMM connected start the rfc2217_server.py. Currently only serial is supported (no HID-Serial)
- start server with: rfc2217_server.py -p <port> <device> e.g.: rfc2217_server.py -p 4000 /dev/ttyUSB0

## Future plans:
- Switch to the Qt chart module for the graph. (QChart branch)
- Split to measuring/recording process to an seperate backgound daemon.
