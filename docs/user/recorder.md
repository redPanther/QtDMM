# The recorder

The recorder graph — shown with the **Graph** toolbar button, hidden by
default and brought up automatically when a recording starts — shows
every reading of the meter's primary value, at the time it came: a short
spike between two others is kept, and a slow meter is drawn from reading to
reading. What it records is the value in base units — a reading of 12.3 mV
is stored as 0.0123 V — so the curve stays continuous when the meter
changes range.

## Live, recording and view

The graph is in one of three modes:

- **Live** — right after connecting the graph runs with the meter: it
  holds the readings of the last recording length (or of the visible
  window when the recording has no length) and older ones fall out on the
  left. The newest reading is at the right edge. Live is no recording: there is
  nothing to lose, and leaving it asks nothing.
- **Recording** — *Record* (the grey dot ● in the toolbar, Space) asks
  for the **Length** of the recording, with the last one ready: Enter
  starts it, ∞ records until stopped. Then it clears the graph and records
  from now on, until the length is reached or you press the button again
  (now a red square ■, *Stop*). Top left in the graph stands
  `● REC 0:42 / 10:00`. A recording keeps all its readings from the start,
  up to two million; beyond that the oldest go.
- **View** — a recording that ended, or a file loaded with *Import*,
  stands in the graph to zoom, scroll, save and export. Top left in grey
  stands where it comes from: `Recording of 06.10.26 14:32 · 10:00`, or
  the file's name.

▶ *Live* in the toolbar is pressed while live and locked while recording;
in View it goes back to Live. Going back to Live, starting a new recording
and importing a file ask first when the readings viewed are not saved yet:
**Export data first**, drop them, or cancel.

*Export* while live saves what the graph holds up to now.

## Sampling

**Settings → Recording** (Ctrl+F2) sets:

- **Sample every** — the grid of the [export](#export-and-import), in
  tenths of a second, seconds, minutes, hours or days: one row per
  interval, the average of the readings in it, each weighted with how long
  it was shown. A reading counts until the next one, at most until it
  [goes stale](#gaps). The graph always shows every reading.

How long a recording runs is asked when you press *Record* (see above).

**Settings → Graph** sets the visible window (**Time axis**) and the
vertical scale (**Y axis**: automatic, or a fixed minimum and maximum).

The status bar shows how much is recorded and the recording's length, the
time left until the length stops the recording, and whether it records:
`0:42 / 10:00 - 9:18 left - Sampling`. While live it shows how much the
live graph holds of what it keeps: `0:42 / 10:00 - Live`.

The vertical axis is in the unit the meter shows - mV while it shows mV -
and in the unit that suits the values for a loaded recording.

## Starting and stopping

Three ways to start, chosen under **Start** on the Recording page:

- **By hand** — *Record* in the toolbar (Space), Ctrl+S and Ctrl+X, or the
  graph's right-click menu.
- **At a clock time** — recording begins at the given time of day.
- **At a threshold** — recording begins when the reading crosses a
  threshold, rising above it or falling below it. The threshold is drawn
  into the graph as a line you can drag. With **Pre-trigger** the recording
  reaches back by the time set there: it takes the readings of that time
  from the live graph, so the recording shows how the value got to the
  threshold, and a green mark shows where it crossed. The length counts
  from the crossing.

A recording started at a clock time or a threshold runs for the length
last chosen when *Record* asked.

The predefined time and the trigger wait while the graph is live. A
recording that ended stands in View and is not overwritten by the next
crossing: press ▶ *Live* to wait for the next one. *Record* starts at once
in every mode.

*Clear* (Ctrl+Del) empties the recording, or the live graph; in View it
goes back to Live. QtDMM warns before you lose unsaved data
by clearing, importing, going back to Live, starting a new recording, switching to another device or
quitting; the warning can be switched off under
**Settings → General → At program exit**.

[Alarms](alarms.md) can start and stop the recorder as well, on any of
their conditions.

A recording measures one thing. When you switch the meter to another
function while it runs - V DC to Ω, DC to AC, °C to °F - the recording
stops, the status bar says what changed, and an orange mark in the graph
shows where. *Record* begins a new recording in the new function. The
stopped one keeps its unit, on the axis and in the export. A change of the
range or prefix (mV to V) is no new function; the recording goes on.

## Gaps

Where the meter showed no value, the curve has a gap instead of a line:

- **OL** - the reading was out of range (overload).
- **No value** - the meter stopped sending, or the connection dropped.
  QtDMM learns how often the meter sends and takes a value as gone after
  three of its intervals (at least 1 s, at most 30 s). The digital display
  and the analog meter fade their value at the same time.

Hovering over a gap shows "OL" or "no value". In the export, an interval
that holds some values and some gaps is the average of the values there
were; the integration curve carries on across a gap.

## Looking at the data

- The buttons at the top right of the graph set the time window: **All**
  shows the whole recording so far and grows with it, **1 min**, **5 min**
  and **30 min** show the last minutes. Buttons longer than the recording
  (its length, or what a stopped recording or a file holds) are left out.
  Zooming ends **All**; the window set under **Settings → Graph → Time
  axis** stays the start. While a recording runs and the graph shows its
  end, the graph follows it; scroll back to stay at a part.
- **Mouse wheel** zooms the time axis; the **middle button** drags it. On the
  keyboard: Ctrl++ / Ctrl+- zoom, Ctrl+0 shows the whole recording, after a
  click into the graph also `+`, `-`, `0`, the arrow keys, Home and End (see
  [Keyboard and mouse](keyboard.md)).
- **Copy image** (right-click menu or Ctrl+Shift+C) puts a picture of the graph
  on the clipboard.
- **Export image...** (right-click menu) writes the graph to a file: **SVG** or
  **PDF** keep the curve, the axes and their labels as vectors, so they stay
  sharp at any size and can be edited in Inkscape or dropped into a document;
  **PNG** and **JPEG** are pixels. The picture is what the graph shows, so zoom
  and pan first.
- Hovering shows a crosshair with the time (to the millisecond) and the
  value of the reading at the cursor.
- **Integration** (**Settings → Graph → Integration curve**) draws a second curve: the
  integral over time of the readings above a threshold, in the unit times
  seconds (V·s, A·s, W·s), scaled and offset as configured — for charge or
  energy over time. Each reading counts for the time it was shown. For
  ampere-hours or watt-hours set the scale to 1/3600, `0.000277778`. A
  scale set before version 26.2, when the curve was the sum of the samples,
  is converted once, so the curve looks as before.
- **Print** (Ctrl+P) prints the graph with a title and comment.

## Colours

**Settings → Graph → Colours** sets the colours of the graph:

- **Neutral** follows the window's design.
- **Scope blue** (the default), **Phosphor green**, **Phosphor amber** and **Chart
  recorder** look like an oscilloscope or a paper recorder. They divide the
  graph into 10 × 8 squares of 1, 2 or 5 units each (1 V, 2 V, 5 V, 10 V,
  ...), so the visible time and the vertical scale grow to whole squares.
  The phosphor colours add a fine scale on the centre lines and dash the
  integration curve.
- **Custom** uses the colour buttons that show up beside it.

A curve colour you chose yourself stays in every variant. The graph's
right-click menu, **Graph colours**, can choose other colours for this graph
only; *Default* goes back to the setting.

## Export and import

*Export* (Ctrl+E) writes the recording on the grid of **Sample every** as
CSV, or - pick the file type in the dialog or just name the file `.xlsx` /
`.ods` - as an Excel or OpenDocument spreadsheet with the same four columns.
The file type **CSV, every reading** writes each reading at its own time
instead, a gap as a row of its own; *Import* reads its times back. In the spreadsheet
the timestamps are date cells (shown with milliseconds) and the values
numbers, so charts and formulas work without converting anything; the
header row is bold and stays put when you scroll. CSV is what *Import*
reads back (spreadsheets are not imported; save as CSV from there).

The CSV is semicolon-separated:

```
timestamp;time (s);value;unit
2026-09-19T10:00:00,000;0;12.3;mV
2026-09-19T10:00:01,000;1;12.4;mV
```

The value is written with an SI prefix and the matching unit, exactly as a
meter would show it. A [gap](#gaps) is written as `nan` in CSV and as an
empty cell in a spreadsheet; *Import* reads `nan` back as a gap. *Import* (Ctrl+I) reads such files back, scaling the
values into base units again, and also accepts the tab-separated format of
QtDMM versions before 0.9.5. The unit of the first row becomes the graph's
unit.
