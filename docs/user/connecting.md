# Connecting a meter

## Choosing the device

Open the settings with **F2** (or the *Configure* button) and go to the
**Multimeter** page.

1. Pick the **vendor** in the first box. The second box then lists only that
   vendor's models. *All vendors* shows the complete list; *Manual settings*
   lets you enter the serial parameters yourself.
2. Pick the **model**. Baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits, protocol and
   display resolution are filled in from QtDMM's device table and locked. You
   can also start typing into the model box; the search covers every vendor
   and switches the vendor box for you.
3. Choose the **port** (see below).
4. Set **DTR** / **RTS** if the meter's cable needs them powered — the
   defaults come from the device table.

Manual settings are for meters that are not in the table yet. If you find a
combination that works, please report it on the project page so it can be
added — see [Supported devices](supported-devices.md).

## Port types

The port box lists everything QtDMM found, prefixed with its type:

| Prefix | Backend | Typical entry |
|---|---|---|
| `Serial` | RS-232 and USB-serial adapters | `/dev/ttyUSB0`, `/dev/ttyS0` (Linux), `/dev/cuaU0` (FreeBSD), `COM3` (Windows) |
| `HID` | USB-HID cables: WCH CH9325 / Hoitek HE2325U (UT-D04 and compatible, many Uni-Trend meters), both revisions of the newer UT-D09 (SiLabs CP2110, or WCH CH9329 at a fixed 9600 8N1; the cable of the UT61B+/D+/E+) and Brymen's BU-86X adapter (BM52x/BM82x/BM86x) | `HID 0x1a86:0xe008 /dev/hidraw2` (Linux), `HID 0x1a86:0xe429 \\?\hid#…` (Windows) |
| `RFC2217` | serial port on another machine, via an RFC 2217 server | `localhost:4000` |
| `Sigrok` | any meter that `sigrok-cli` supports; the SCPI bench meters in the model list set this up in their own group ([Bench meters](bench-meters.md)) | `scpi-dmm:conn=/dev/ttyUSB0` |
| `BLE` | Bluetooth LE broadcasts: Victron SmartShunt / MPPT / Phoenix Inverter ([Bluetooth LE](bluetooth.md)); set up in its own group instead of the port box | `CB:09:E4:16:33:DB` |
| `BLEGATT` | Bluetooth LE connection: UNI-T UT60BT ([Bluetooth LE](bluetooth.md)); set up in the same group | `18:90:67:F1:AB:9E` |

RFC2217 and sigrok entries are not detected automatically - except the
ports of a [qtdmm-bridge](remote-bridge.md) announcing itself by mDNS, which
**Find bridges** on the Special ports page lists. Otherwise add them under
**Settings → Special ports**: choose the type and type the host:port or the
`sigrok-cli` driver string. For sigrok, `sigrok-cli --help` and the
[sigrok hardware list](https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Multimeters)
tell you the driver string; the path to `sigrok-cli` can be set on the same
page if it is not in your `PATH`.

Any program that fully implements RFC 2217 (including remote port setup) works
as the server, e.g. `ser2net`. QtDMM ships its own: **qtdmm-bridge**
(`tools/qtdmm-bridge/` in the sources), a single Python file for a Raspberry
Pi or any other box next to the meters:

```
qtdmm_bridge.py --list                                   # what is connected?
qtdmm_bridge.py --port 4000=/dev/ttyUSB0 --port 4001=/dev/ttyUSB1
```

It serves one meter per TCP port, needs only Python 3.11 and pyserial, keeps
the connection when a cable is unplugged and re-plugged, and takes the line
settings from QtDMM - the meter model is chosen in QtDMM as usual. On Linux
it also serves the **USB-HID cables** (`hid:1a86:e008` for a UT-D04/UT803
type cable, UT-D09, Brymen BU-86X), so a HID meter on a Raspberry Pi is
reachable over the network too. See its `README.md` for the configuration
file, the udev rule and the SSH-tunnel setup; there is no authentication, so
keep it on a trusted network. The whole setup, including running the bridge
as a service, is on [Meters over the network](remote-bridge.md).

## Connecting

Click **Connect** (Ctrl+C) in the toolbar. QtDMM connects on its own at
start-up once a meter has been chosen in the settings; a fresh instance
waits for you to configure one. The status line at the bottom shows what is
happening:

- *Connecting …* — the port is open, waiting for the first frame.
- *Connected /dev/ttyUSB0* — readings arrive; the display and the recorder are
  live.
- *Timeout on device …* — the port is open but nothing has arrived for three
  seconds. Check that the meter is switched on, that its RS-232 output is
  enabled (many meters have a button or menu entry for it), and DTR/RTS. With
  a USB-HID cable the message says whether the cable answers while the meter
  stays silent.
- *Lost connection to … Retrying every 5 s.* — the port went away: cable
  unplugged, bridge or sigrok-cli gone, connection refused. QtDMM keeps
  trying as long as **Connect** is pressed and picks up again as soon as the
  device is back; the recording continues where it was.
- *No permission to access …* — see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).

Clicking **Connect** again disconnects and frees the port for other programs.

## The display

The LCD-style display mirrors the meter: value, unit, the annunciators HOLD,
AUTO, MANU, AC, DC, diode and continuity (unlit ones stay faintly visible,
like on the meter itself), the bar graph and, below the value, the minimum
and maximum since the last **Reset** (Ctrl+R), each as the meter showed it
("MIN 221.18 mV" stays so when the meter has moved on to V). A range change
(mV to V, kΩ to MΩ) keeps them; they start afresh when the meter switches to
another function (V DC to Ω, DC to AC, °C to °F). An overload changes
nothing.

The display is a window like the [analog meter](analog-meter.md); digits and
lettering scale with it. **Display** in the toolbar or the menu (Ctrl+1)
hides and shows it. Bar graph and min/max (off by default) are set on the
*Appearance* settings page, in the group *Digital display (LCD)*.

**LCD colours** in the display's right-click menu: *Classic* (the
yellow-green of most meters), *Backlight blue* (light segments on blue, the default),
*Amber*, *High contrast* (black on white) or *Custom*, the tint from the
*Appearance* page. Changing that tint switches the display to *Custom*.

For meters whose keys QtDMM knows (the UNI-T UT60BT, UT61B+/D+/E+ and
UT161), a row of the meter's keys sits under the display: SELECT and Hz/%,
RANGE and AUTO, HOLD, REL, MIN/MAX and PEAK, LIGHT. HOLD and AUTO light up
as the meter reports them. **Pressing a key does nothing yet** - sending it
to the meter comes in a later version. The small triangle in the display's
top right corner, or **Hide controls** in its right-click menu, folds the
row away.

## Window layout

The main window holds five windows: the digital display, the analog meter,
the recorder graph, the [readings table](readings-table.md) and the
[Poincaré plot](poincare-plot.md). The toolbar buttons (or Ctrl+1 … Ctrl+5)
show and hide them. A fresh QtDMM starts as a
compact instrument with display and meter only; starting a recording shows
the graph.

The first start sizes the main window for what it shows. When you switch on
the graph or the table for the first time, the window grows to make room -
down for the graph, to the right for the table - up to most of the screen;
it never shrinks by itself. Once you have sized, maximized or snapped the
window yourself, it keeps your size. The window title names the configured meter; in the status bar a
dot blinks green while readings come in and turns grey when none has come
for three seconds.

**Arrange** in the toolbar (and in the menu) chooses how the windows are
placed:

- **Displays on top** (the default): display and meter share a strip at the
  top, the graph takes the space below and the readings table a column on
  the right. Everything follows the size of the main window.
- **Displays on the left**: the same with display and meter in a column on
  the left.
- **Fixed**: keeps the layout as it is. From *Displays on top* or *on the
  left* it takes that layout over; from *Free* the windows snap into a grid
  made from where they are (it shows for a moment first). A window shown
  later gets a place at the bottom edge, a hidden one leaves its space to its
  neighbours.
- **Free**: place and size the windows yourself; QtDMM remembers where they
  are.

In the arranged modes the gaps between the windows are dividers: drag one to
share the space differently (the mouse pointer changes on them; they can
also be taken a few pixels inside a window's edge). Drag a window with
Ctrl held - or at its title bar - onto another one and the two swap places;
dropped elsewhere it goes back. A layout changed like this is remembered.
In *Displays on top* and *on the left* it lasts until a window is shown or
hidden; then the windows are placed by the rule again.

**Load workspace...** and **Save workspace...** in the same menu keep a
window layout in a file (`*.qtdmm-workspace`): which windows are shown, the
arrangement with its dividers, the title bars, the design and the size of
the main window - for instance one layout for the bench and one for long
recordings. **Save layout on exit** (on by default) makes QtDMM start with
the layout it had when it was closed. Switched off, it starts with the
layout it had when the option was switched off, or with the workspace
loaded last.

**Hide title bars** (Ctrl+L) takes the title bars away so the windows sit
flush next to each other - the default for the arranged modes. Right-click
the display or the meter for its window menu (hide the window, title bar on
or off); in *Free* mode Ctrl+drag moves a window without title bar. Window
layouts of versions before 26.1 are not taken over.

**Design** in the menu, or on the *Appearance* settings page, sets the colours
of the window: *System* (the look of your desktop), *Silver* (brushed
aluminium) or *Dark* (the default). The readings table
and a graph in the colours *Neutral* follow; the LCD colours, the graph's
colours and the style of the analog meter are chosen separately.

**Settings → Appearance → Symbols** chooses the toolbar and menu symbols:
*Coloured* (KDE's Oxygen icons, the default), *Plain* (KDE's monochrome Breeze
icons, light or dark to match the window) or, on Linux and BSD where the
desktop has an icon theme, *System* - your desktop's symbols, with the
plain set for QtDMM's own symbols and anything the theme lacks.
