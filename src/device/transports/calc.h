///
/// The inputs come from SharedStateManager::readings(); every poll interval
/// the formula is evaluated and the result is offered as a sigrok-style
/// text line ("DC 6.02 W AUTO", padded to 30 bytes like SigrokDevice does),
/// so the ASCII decoder (FrameFormat::Sigrok) and everything after it work
/// unchanged. Instance ids are the variables; a hyphen in an id can be
/// written as an underscore in the formula. The variable t is reserved: the
/// seconds since the device was opened, which together with sin(), rand()
/// and friends makes a signal generator ("QtDMM / Simulated meter" is this
/// device with a formula built from a few fields). While an input is missing,
/// invalid or older than three seconds the line carries "inf", which the
/// display shows as OL, and status() explains which input is the problem.
///
/// Up to kMaxValues values, separated by ';' ("V 12 + t; A 0.5; W v1 * v2"):
/// value n can use the ones before it as v1, v2 ...; each tick then gives a
/// line per value with sigrok-cli's channel in front ("P2: 0.500 A DC
/// AUTO"), which the decoder makes value n-1 (the main value is P1).
