QtDMM 0.9.8 Installation Instructions
(c) 2001â€“2014 M. Toussaint

QtDMM is a graphical front-end for digital multimeters. It was originally
developed for Qt5, which is now end-of-life (EOL). Work is ongoing to support
Qt6 as well. Qt5 is still the recommended choice, but Qt6 builds are welcome
for testing.


Requirements:
=============
- developer version of Qt 5.14 or higher (recommended) or Qt 6.x
- CMake version 3.11 or higher
- A supported or compatible multimeter


Compilation:
============
A helper script named `compile.sh` is included for convenience. You may use
it or follow the standard CMake workflow.

Basic steps:
------------
- Download and extract the QtDMM source code from GitHub:
  https://github.com/tuxmaster/QtDMM
- Open a terminal and change to the QtDMM directory:
    cd QtDMM

- For a clean build (optional):
    ./compile.sh clean <other options>

Building with Qt5 (Recommended):
-------------------------------
Build and install system-wide:
    ./compile.sh install

Build only (no installation):
    ./compile.sh

The compiled binary will be placed in the `./bin` directory:
    ./bin/qtdmm

Building with Qt6 (Experimental):
--------------------------------
like Qt5 build, but add `qt6` ardument, e.g.:
    ./compile.sh qt6 install


Multimeter Compatibility:
=========================
If your DMM is not listed in the model selection (see README), try:
- Using manual configuration
- Selecting a similar model

Incorrect settings are unlikely to damage your device. In the worst case,
the multimeter may stop responding. Power-cycling it will usually fix this.


Feedback & Support:
===================
