Installation QtDMM 0.9.8 (c) 2001-2014 M.Toussaint

Requirements:
-------------
- Qt library 5.x developer version
- cmake 3.5 or higher
- A supported multimeter or a compatible model


Compilation:
------------
- untar the tarball you've downloaded
- enter the qtdmm directory

no system wide installation:
- type ./compile.sh
- you will find the executable in ./bin directory

system wide installation:
- type ./compile.sh install

if you want to remove all build files
- type ./compile.sh clean

That's it. You should have the executable qtdmm now.

If your DMM isn't listed in the model combo (list see README), just try to
find manual settings, or a  compatible model. It is very unlikely that wrong 
settings cause harm to your DMM. Worst case could be that it hangs. 
Switching it off will reset it.

If you find working settings or encounter any problems don't hesitate to
contact via our github page.
