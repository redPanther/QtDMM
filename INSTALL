QtDMM Installation Instructions
(c) 2001â€“2014 M. Toussaint

QtDMM is a graphical front-end for digital multimeters based on Qt6 framework.


Requirements:
=============
- developer version of Qt 6 + qserialport
- CMake version 3.11 or higher
- hidapi (ubuntu: libhidapi-devel, libhidapi-hidraw0 | fedora: hidapi-devel, hidapi)
- A supported or compatible multimeter


Compilation:
============
A helper script named `compile.sh` is included for convenience. You may use
it or follow the standard CMake workflow.

Basic steps:
------------
- Download and extract the QtDMM source code from GitHub:
  https://github.com/tuxmaster/QtDMM
- Open a terminal and change to the QtDMM directory:
    cd QtDMM

- For a clean build (optional):
    ./compile.sh clean <other options>

- Build and install system-wide:
    ./compile.sh install
or
- Build only (no installation):
    ./compile.sh

- The compiled binary will be placed in the `./bin` directory:
    ./bin/qtdmm


Multimeter Compatibility:
=========================
If your DMM is not listed in the model selection (see README), try:
- Using manual configuration
- Selecting a similar model

Incorrect settings are unlikely to damage your device. In the worst case,
the multimeter may stop responding. Power-cycling it will usually fix this.


Feedback & Support:
===================
If you find working settings for an unsupported device or encounter problems,
please get in touch via the GitHub project page:
